# AutoYaST Profiles Repository

This repository provides example XML profiles for AutoYaST.

They can be used for quick testing without need for writing your profiles and
configuring your own HTTP/FTP/NFS server to serve them. You can also use the
profiles as a template for your own configurations.

The pages are available at [https://autoyast.github.io](https://autoyast.github.io).

## Warning

:warning: This site is still a proof of concept, the file names and URL paths
can be still changed!! :warning:

## TODO

- [ ] Add more profiles
- [ ] Maybe the page and profiles structure will require changes after
      adding many more files
- [ ] Add more descriptions to the profiles and more comments into the XML files
      themselves
- [ ] Automatic profile validation (via Travis)
